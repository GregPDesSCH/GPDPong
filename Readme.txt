GPD Pong - 3D Pong clone

By Gregory Desrosiers

This is my first Unity project to be published, available for play on Kongregate, GameJolt, itch.io, and Newgrounds. It's a clone of Atari's PONG from 1972 as a training project in learning Unity and understanding how things work.

All the resources from the Unity project except the music and sound effects are here for review. What you don't see are the builds because Unity generates these based on the target platform.


Development Dates: June 2016 - August 2016

Special Thanks to the staff who put the tutorials together on Unity Technologies and both Unity Forums and Unity Answers moderators for giving me the flexibility to ask various questions on how different things work and giving me different ways to program.
